# Project: Towers of Hanoi

# This project is a program that implements the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. In this puzzle, there are three pegs, with a certain number of disks on one of the pegs (the number of disks is specified by the user). After the user enters the number of disks, the program executes a series of steps. In each step, two numbers are printed, which correspond to the peg numbers from left to right. These numbers mean that in a simulation of the puzzle, the user would move a disk from the peg number listed on the left to the peg number listed on the right (see example). The goal of this simulation is to move all the disks from the first peg to the third peg, such that only one disk can be moved at a time, and that a bigger disk can't be placed on a smaller disk.

```Enter the number of disks: 3
 1          3
 1          2
 3          2
 1          3
 2          1
 2          3
 1          3
```
